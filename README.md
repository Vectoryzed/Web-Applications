# Web Applications specialization (University of Michigan)

This specialization is a basic introduction to building web applications, and is an excellent starting point for learners who already have a basic understanding of programming, HTML, and CSS. In Web Applications for Everybody, learners will be introduced to web and database applications in PHP, using SQL for database creation, as well as functionality in JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON.

_______________________________________________________________________________

# 1 - Building Web Applications in PHP
In this course, you'll explore the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server. You'll be introduced to the request/response cycle, including GET/POST/Redirect. You'll also gain an introductory understanding of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), as well as the basic syntax and data structures of the PHP language, variables, logic, iteration, arrays, error handling, and superglobal variables, among other elements. An introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) will allow you to style markup for webpages. Lastly, you'll gain the skills and knowledge to install and use an integrated PHP/MySQL environment like XAMPP or MAMP.

<b>Main topics:</b>
- Introduction to Dynamic Web Content
- HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
- Installing PHP and SQL
- Introduction to PHP
- PHP Arrays
- PHP Functions
- PHP and HTML Forms

# 2 - Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL)
In this course, you'll walk through installation steps for installing a text editor, installing MAMP or XAMPP (or equivalent) and creating a MySql Database. You'll learn about single table queries and the basic syntax of the SQL language, as well as database design with multiple tables, foreign keys, and the JOIN operation. Lastly, you'll learn to model many-to-many relationships like those needed to represent users, roles, and courses.

<b>Main topics:</b>
- Introduction to Structured Quert Language (SQL)
- Database Design
- Many-to-Many Relationships

# 3 - Building Database Applications in PHP
In this course, we'll look at the object oriented patterns available in PHP. You'll learn how to connect to a MySQL using the Portable Data Objects (PDO) library and issue SQL commands in the the PHP language. We'll also look at how PHP uses cookies and manages session data. You'll learn how PHP avoids double posting data, how flash messages are implemented, and how to use a session to log in users in web applications. We'll then build the first 'complete' application that has multiple screens to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) our data. This brings all the previous concepts together and will form the basis for all later web applications.

<b>Main topics:</b>
- PHP Objects
- Connecting PHP and MySQL
- PHP Cookies and Sessions
- PHP Redirect, Routing and Authentication
- Building a CRUD Application

# 4 - JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON
In this course, we'll look at the JavaScript language, and how it supports the Object-Oriented pattern, with a focus on the unique aspect of how JavaScript approaches OO. We'll explore a brief introduction to the jQuery library, which is widely used to do in-browser manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) and event handling. You'll also learn more about JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), which is commonly used as a syntax to exchange data between code running on the server (i.e. in PHP) and code running in the browser (JavaScript/jQuery).

<b>Main topics:</b>
- Introduction to JavaScript
- JavaScript Objects
- Using jQuery
- JSON: JavaScript Objects Notation
