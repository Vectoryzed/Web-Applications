# Database with jQuery and JSON: project overview

In this assignment you will extend our simple resume database to support Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations (CRUD) into a Education table that has a many-to-one relationship to our Profile table and a many-to-many relationship to an Institution table. We will add an JQuery autocomplete field to our user interface.
